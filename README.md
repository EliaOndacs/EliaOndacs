# About Me

hello!, my name is Elia Ondacs, I'm a programmer (Duh), and been in the industry for a while. 

## Languages that i use

i like to prototype the ideas that comes to my mind, so i like to use python, but outside of that I'm also a python freak,

but i do use JavaScript, Typescript, C, C++ (rarely), Bash Script and Tcl

## My Active Projects

most of my current active projects are not published on GitHub, like hrame which is supposed to be a web framework, VageVM a cross platform Virtual machine with its own CPU architecture.

## Code Editor that i like to use

vim, neovim (at least trying to) and vscode.

## FAQ

do i use Linux, and hate on windows? Yes And No, i Use Both, *I'm Not Just A Programmer* so i still need windows, for my other stuff, but i did use a ton of software to make my windows not look and feel like windows

What The Hell Is Tcl? a old programming language that is similar to Bash Script but better, not much resource but you can look it up, I'm obsessed with it :)

Why Most Of My Projects are not on GitHub? cause I'm still not sure of them or whether they become a successful project, so yeah.
